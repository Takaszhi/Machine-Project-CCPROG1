# Machine-Project-CCPROG1

Hi sir, this is so far what I have done, I am currently working on the back end of the program, front end can be easily done. I'm working on the pointers, so far it still has bugs such as going back to the original value after doing a two or more transactions. Will work on this this weekend, planning to submit on June 25 if that is fine... Thank you sir!
